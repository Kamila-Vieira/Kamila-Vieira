### Hi there, :heart:

My name is Kamila, but you can call me Kamis or Ka ðŸ˜„.

I am migrating from Fraud Prevention to the technology area, 
studying to act as a Front-End Developer.
In addition to immersive and self-taught studies of basic structures (HTML and CSS), 
ðŸŒ± I am absorbing a lot of javascript content and its main frameworks (Currently JQuery and React).
I am studying Systems Development Technician at ETEC.
